# Cat vs. Dog Classification with Teachable Machine

This repository demonstrates how to create a simple image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using Google’s Teachable Machine. The project utilizes a user-friendly interface to train a machine learning model without extensive coding.

## Overview

Teachable Machine allows users to easily train models for image classification. This project captures the process of training a model to classify images of cats and dogs, along with a simple web application to test the model.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies images as either a cat or a dog.
- **Interactive Training**: Train the model using your own images.
- **Web Application**: A demo web app that allows users to upload images and receive classification results in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (preferably Chrome)
- Basic understanding of image classification concepts

### Steps to Create Your Classifier

1. **Access Teachable Machine**:
   - Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Select "Get Started" and choose the "Image Project" option.

3. **Upload Images**:
   - Create two classes: one for cats and one for dogs.
   - Upload multiple images of each category to train the model effectively.

4. **Train Your Model**:
   - After uploading the images, click on "Train Model."
   - Wait for the training process to complete.

5. **Export Your Model**:
   - Once training is complete, export the model by selecting "Export Model."
   - Choose the option to download the model or integrate it into a web app
